    <p class="descrpt">
        Hi, I'm Ramya, a 19-year-old college freshman at William Jewell College, where I'm diving into the world of computer science. I have a passion for technology and enjoy exploring new ideas in coding and software development. When I'm not studying, you can find me playing video games, reading, or getting creative with some drawing. I'm excited to learn and grow in this field!

    <h3 class="things">My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p class="descrpt">
        I really love to play video games, mostly the story based ones. I'm actually playing a game called detroit become human right now, where it's based on three androids and you navigate through their lives as they live in a world that doesn't really like androids all that much. It's a really good game and I highly recommend it!
